'''
4) Develop an algorithm that reads two integers and displays their sum.
Example:
Enter a value: 8
Enter another value: 5
The sum of 8 and 5 is equal to 13.
'''

num_1 = int(input('Enter a number: '))
num_2 = int(input('Enter another number: '))

sum = num_1 + num_2

print(f'The sum between {num_1} and {num_2} is {sum}')
